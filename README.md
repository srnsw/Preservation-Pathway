# Digital Archives Metadata Registry

The Digital Archives Metadata Registry is a publicly accessible web service capable of:

- allowing Digital Archives staff to progressively register preferences for published metadata terms (e.g. Dublin Core) to represent common metadata elements in the digital archives
- allowing Digital Archives staff to progressively coin new terms (by providing a URI and description) to represent metadata elements in the digital archives for which no suitable published term can be identified
- informing NSW government agencies wishing to transfer digital archives of State Records' metadata preferences
- informing users accessing the digital archives of the full set of searchable metadata fields in the system
- providing a 'best practice' reference for NSW government agencies wishing to standardise metadata used in agency recordkeeping systems
- providing a useful resource for the digital preservation and recordkeeping communities.
