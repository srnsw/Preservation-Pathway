# Digital Archives Preservation Pathways Registry

This application records preferences for file format conversion operations. Basically, a recommendation to turn an input file with X PUID (using IDs from the National Archives PRONOM registry - http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/Default.aspx) into the format defined by Y PUID. Preferences can be registered for different purposes e.g. for “access” purposes we might recommend DOC->PDF, but for “preservation” purposes we might suggest DOC->ODF (just an example, not an actual policy in the registry). 

Available publicly as a handy reference for the NSW jurisdiction (so that an agency that encounters records in a certain format can quickly find State Records NSW’s recommended pathway for that format). It also produces machine readable output (JSON) that the Digital Archives Workflow Controller tool can consume (to automate format conversions where appropriate).
